# Handling-LiDAR-data
This project focuses on the development of a Composite Land Degradation Index (CLDI) using LiDAR-derived data. Land degradation poses significant threats to ecosystems, agriculture, and human settlements. High-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology offers precise terrain and vegetation data, enabling advanced analysis of degradation patterns.

The goal of this project is to integrate multiple degradation indicators extracted from LiDAR data—such as elevation changes, slope, vegetation height, surface roughness, and erosion risk—into a composite index that can effectively identify and quantify areas under varying degrees of land degradation.

Key Features
✅ LiDAR Data Processing:
Import, clean, and preprocess raw LiDAR point cloud data.

✅ Topographic Analysis:
Derive Digital Elevation Models (DEM), slope, aspect, and other terrain attributes.

✅ Vegetation Metrics:
Extract canopy height, cover density, and vegetation structure from LiDAR returns.

✅ Erosion & Surface Stability Metrics:
Estimate indicators such as roughness, flow accumulation, and erosion susceptibility.

✅ Composite Index Computation:
Normalize and integrate multiple indicators into a single degradation index.

✅ Visualization & Mapping:
Generate spatial maps of degradation zones for interpretation and decision-making.

✅ Export & Reporting:
Export results for further GIS analysis or reporting.
